Hexcalour is a game of based on colors. This game is a two player game where each player competes to take over half the board. The first player who succeeds wons on that board. 
Rules:

Technologies used:
    •HTML
    •CSS: modals
    •JavaScript: loops, math methods/randomization, array methods, event listeners, callback

Motivation:
    I made this game because I played a game like it when I was younger. I really missed the game and wanted to play it again so I decided to make something similar.

Build Status:
    I'm pretty much done with creating this game, it doesn't have all the additional things I would like to include.

Code Style: 
    I didn't use anything too crazy. Mostly just used basic javascript.
